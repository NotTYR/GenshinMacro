How To Use
1. Make a shortcut to the ahk script
2. In the compability of the shortcut set it as run as administrator
3. Before playing Genshin turn on the ahk script, it launches Genshin
4. This is the Beta Version. Coop joining is very unstable, might fail.

Things I can work on:
Coop Timer(To prevent Coop failure)
Focalors' local speciality script
Ores(should be the easiest)
